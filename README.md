# How 'Smart' Is Smart Money? - A Short Finance Research Project

The thesis investigates the efficient market hypothesis on whether investors are smart enough to identify funds that beat the market. 
Can they predict superior performance or are they simply naively chasing star funds (called the momentum effect)?

The results found evidence for the smart money effect for corporate bond funds using a three-factor linear regression model. 
Research also suggests that there remain significant differences between the behavior of bond and equity investors.
